# DVT setup components

The DVT setup consists of four components working together to enable distributed validator operations.

## DVT cluster of distributed validators

The distributed validator cluster performs validator duties (attestations, proposals) through a network of operators running DVT clients.

## StakeWise Operator

StakeWise [operator ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-operator) registers validators in the Vault contract. The operator doesn't have access to validator keystores.

## DVT Relayer

DVT [relayer ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/dvt-relayer) provides validator registration data to the StakeWise Operator. It handles validators whose private keys were generated through distributed key generation (DKG) and coordinates validator exit requests.

:::custom-warning[Security]
In production, the DVT relayer should not have access to DV keystores.

## DVT sidecars

DVT [sidecar ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/dvt-operator-sidecar) runs on each DVT operator node in the cluster. It loads DV keystores, polls validator exits from the Relayer, and pushes exit signature shares back to the Relayer.

:::custom-notes[Deployment]
One sidecar instance required per DVT operator in the cluster.
