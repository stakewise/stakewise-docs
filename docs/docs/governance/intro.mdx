# Governance

StakeWise is governed by its community through the **SWISE** token. The governance system empowers token holders to shape the protocol's future by voting on key parameters and proposals.

## How Governance Works

The StakeWise DAO is responsible for making critical decisions about the protocol, including:

- Setting fees and commissions
- Managing oracles and node operators
- Approving protocol upgrades and new features
- Controlling the DAO Treasury

Governance decisions are implemented through **StakeWise Improvement Proposals (SWIPs)**, which are discussed and voted on by SWISE token holders.

## Governance Structure

The governance system consists of two main components:

- **[StakeWise DAO →](./stakewise-dao)**: The community-driven governance mechanism powered by the SWISE token
- **[DAO Treasury →](./dao-treasury)**: A multi-signature wallet managed by a committee that executes approved governance decisions
