# osToken

osToken is a liquid staking token that accrues staking rewards when held. It is a generic name for StakeWise's network-specific ERC-20 tokens:

- **osETH** on Ethereum
- **osGNO** on Gnosis Chain

osToken is issued against assets staked in a Vault to allow using staked capital in decentralized applications to trade, borrow, lend, and restake. Hence, osTokens represent the underlying staked assets and the rewards earned.

Short for **Overcollateralized Staked Token**, osToken requires that the value of staked assets exceed the value of osToken issued. This overcollateralization acts as a safety buffer, protecting holders and the protocol from validator penalties or underperformance of permissionless Vaults.

A defining feature is that osToken can be minted against validators run by anyone – from solo stakers to professional operators – making access to liquid staking fully permissionless and non-custodial.
