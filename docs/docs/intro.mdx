# The StakeWise Protocol

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This documentation is designed to guide you in using StakeWise to stake and operate on your terms. It covers the protocol fundamentals, explains the protocol mechanics, and provides walkthroughs for a confident start.

Whether you are taking your first steps into liquid staking, running infrastructure, or navigating as a seasoned DeFi user, these pages help you unlock the potential of capital.

<h3>The Art of Liquid Staking</h3>

<h4>The Traditional Staking Dilemma</h4>
Traditional Proof-of-Stake staking operates on a simple premise: lock tokens, earn fixed rewards, repeat. While this bond-like approach guarantees returns, it has a severe limitation: stake is illiquid. You are locked out of DeFi yield opportunities. The art lies in transcending this either-or paradigm by having the best of both worlds.

<h4>Solution</h4>
Liquid staking transforms your stake into a tradeable asset through tokenization. When you stake cryptocurrency through a liquid staking protocol, you receive st[token] that represent your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards. The st[token]  function as liquid representations that unlock the entire DeFi ecosystem while your original stake continues earning validation rewards. You can now earn rewards from both staking and using your liquid tokens in additional protocols—as collateral for lending, in yield farming strategies, or trading on decentralized exchanges.

<h4>Staking Options</h4>
Solo staking can be prohibitive for those who don't have the 32 ETH required by Ethereum. Traditional alternatives that require no in-depth programming knowledge or hardware setup include staking-as-a-service (SaaS) providers or centralized exchanges, but both come with trade-offs: SaaS providers still require the full 32 ETH minimum and provide no liquid staking benefits, while centralized exchanges have one intrinsic flaw: centralization, which contradicts crypto's original decentralization ethos. While APRs may appear attractive, "not your keys, not your crypto," as the saying goes.

<h4>The Deeper Issue</h4>
Liquid staking protocols eliminate financial and technical barriers to maximize your stake while letting you participate in DeFi. You can stake any amount you wish in a non-custodial manner. But liquid staking comes with considerations, such as validator slashing, smart contract risk, and depegging risk. There's a deeper issue beyond mere liquidity: most liquid staking protocols use pre-configured validator sets, which can lead to centralization around the biggest node operators. You don't know where your stake will end up. With StakeWise you can actively support decentralization by either running your own node or choosing to stake with specific operators of your choice. Liquid staking represents the evolution of staking from a binary choice to a strategic optimization tool. The future of staking is liquid, and it's available today.

<h3>What is StakeWise?</h3>

StakeWise is the premier liquid staking protocol on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, enabling simple and secure staking for individuals and organizations. It also provides tools and software that allow anyone to launch their own staking pool (called a Vault) and earn fees by running validators for others.

Our design philosophy is simple: advancing decentralization by giving anyone the chance to stake on their own terms. Anyone can leverage StakeWise to achieve their unique staking goals. The system is maximally customizable and secure, offering diverse staking solutions for every user type. StakeWise's architecture delivers enhanced control across the entire staking stack — validator selection, fee structures, MEV strategies, and risk parameters — while preserving the non-custodial, permissionless nature that defines decentralized finance. Users can operate their own nodes, mint their own osTokens, and participate in DeFi protocols while maintaining complete asset custody. By holding osToken, you've effectively built a personal bank that earns staking rewards while participating in DeFi's endless opportunities.

<h3>Core Architecture</h3>

StakeWise's architecture rests on three foundational pillars: Vaults, osToken, and Oracles.

<h4>Vaults</h4>
StakeWise pioneers the Vault marketplace model. Vaults are highly customizable smart contracts that can be used as a staking pool for any use case.
Anyone can launch a Vault, stake in Vaults, and mint osToken, with Vault operators earning a staking fee in exchange.

<h4>osToken</h4>
osToken is the main liquid staking token for the StakeWise ecosystem, representing osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. osTokens accrue native staking rewards when held and are minted by stakers in Vaults who want to use their stake in DeFi.

<h4>Oracles</h4>
Oracles calculate and submit periodic rewards for the Vaults. They also validate and sign validator registrations and consolidations.

StakeWise stays aligned with Ethereum's roadmap, researching upcoming changes and adapting proactively for optimal performance.
