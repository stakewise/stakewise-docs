<p style={{fontSize: '1.2em', color: 'rgba(var(--moon-rgb), .5)', marginTop: '-10px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>Learn how to change your withdrawal credentials to a 0x01 type</p>

:::custom-warning[Important Notice]
Partial and full withdrawals from staking require validators to have an execution layer address, known as the `0x01` withdrawal address. By default, validators created using StakeWise Solo have `0x00` withdrawal credentials, which must be changed to `0x01` withdrawal address to exit from staking or benefit from partial withdrawals. This guide will teach you how to change `0x00` withdrawal credentials to a `0x01` address.
:::

We created a guide to walk you through the process of changing withdrawal credentials.

To find the right guide for you, choose your operating system.

        :::custom-warning[Important]
        Ensure that the Windows machine you are using for executing the change in withdrawal credentials is not infected with any malware and can be disconnected from the Internet at a certain stage of the credentials change process.

        If you are not using anti-virus software regularly, we recommend that you use a trial version of malwarebytes.com to conduct a full scan of your machine before proceeding with the credentials change process.
        :::

        :::custom-info[Note]
        You will need the mnemonic (seed phrase) you used for creating Solo validators to execute this procedure. Do not discard the mnemonic (seed phrase) after you complete the procedure and continue to keep it safe (ideally stored offline or on an airgapped machine).
        :::

        :::custom-info[Note]
        You will need to provide a withdrawal address where your validator funds will be withdrawn to. Make sure that the address you choose is not compromised, does not have approvals for ETH spending to unknown contracts, and is overall safe to use.
        :::

        Executing a change of withdrawal credentials on Windows is a fairly straightforward process. We will:

        1. Find out the public BLS credentials of your Solo validators
        2. Download and launch staking-deposit-cli using Command Line
        3. Generate a .json file for rotating withdrawal credentials to `0x01` address
        4. Broadcast the .json file's message to the Ethereum Network

        The whole procedure will take at most 10 minutes.

        ## Find Out Your BLS Withdrawal Credentials

        Before we can begin the credentials change procedure, you will need to get a list of public BLS credentials for all of your Solo validators.

        :::custom-info[Contact StakeWise Team]
        To obtain your validator indices and withdrawal credentials, please contact the StakeWise team via [Discord ↗](https://discord.gg/stakewise) or email at info@stakewise.io.
        :::

        ## Download and Launch Ethereum Staking Deposit CLI

        1. Go to the [StakeWise Github page](https://github.com/stakewise/staking-deposit-cli/releases/tag/v2.5.1) and download the Windows version of `staking_deposit-cli` zip archive
        :::custom-info[Note]
        The version of the `staking_deposit-cli` is based on the original cli by the Ethereum Foundation which was modified by StakeWise.
        :::
        2. In your `Downloads` folder, right-click on the downloaded package and select **Extract All**. Set `Desktop` as your destination folder
        3. Rename the extracted folder to `staking_deposit-cli`
        4. Move the `deposit.exe` file one directory up i.e., place it into the `staking_deposit-cli` folder
        5. Disconnect your machine from the Internet / disable Internet at your location to prevent possible intereference with the next steps
        :::custom-warning[Important]
        Failing to disconnect from the Internet might expose your machine to online interference with the credentials change procedure and result in a loss of all funds. We strongly recommend disconnecting / disabling the Internet connection at your location before you proceed.
        :::
        6. Launch the **Command Line** with Administrator privileges by typing `cmd` into the Windows search bar and using right-click to `Run as administrator`
        7. Navigate to the extracted files using the following command in the **Command Line** (insert your Windows profile name instead of YOURPROFILE):
        ```jsx
        cd /d %YOURPROFILE%/Desktop/staking_deposit-cli
        ```
        8. Launch the `staking_deposit-cli` and initiate the credentials change process with the following command in the **Command Line**:
        ```jsx
        deposit generate-bls-to-execution-change
        ```

        At this stage, you should see the tool running, asking for your choice of language before you proceed.

        ## Generate a `.json` File for Credentials Rotation

        1. Choose your preferred language for the procedure by entering the relevant number in the **Command Line** (use `3` for English)
        2. Type in `mainnet` into the **Command Line** when prompted to choose the network
        3. Type in your mnemonic (seed phrase) into the **Command Line** when prompted to choose the network (every word must be separated by a space)
        4. Type `0` into the **Command Line** when prompted to enter the index position for the keys
        5. Copy the `Validator index list` from the **text file** you downloaded from StakeWise and paste into the **Command Line** when prompted to enter the list of validator index numbers
        6. Copy the `Withdrawal credentials list` from the **text file** you downloaded from StakeWise and paste into the Command Line when prompted to enter the list of old BLS withdrawal credentials
        7. Copy the withdrawal address you would like to use for the withdrawal of validator funds and paste into the **Command Line** when prompted to enter the new execution address
        :::custom-warning[Important]
        Please double-check the withdrawal address you insert to ensure that you entered the correct address. Entering the wrong address will result in a loss of all funds.
        :::
        8. Copy and paste the withdrawal address into the **Command Line** again when asked to repeat
        At this stage, you will have generated a .json file that can be found in the `staking_deposit-cli` folder

        ## Broadcast the `.json` File Message to the Network

        1. Head to the [Beacon Chain Explorer](https://beaconcha.in/tools/broadcast) website
        2. Upload your `.json` file into the relevant form

        At this stage, your BLS withdrawal credentials should be changed to `0x01` withdrawal address to enable partial and full withdrawals for your Solo validators. Congratulations!

        :::custom-info[Note]
        If you are unsure whether the procedure was successful, in about 1 hour after the procedure visit https://beaconcha.in/validator/index#withdrawals by replacing "index" with your actual validator index (e.g., `https://beaconcha.in/validator/156849#withdrawals`).


        If the procedure was successful, then you should see an expected date of the first partial withdrawal (i.e., rewards payout) from your validator. If you don't see it, please refer to the guide again.

        ## Download and Launch Ethereum Staking Deposit CLI

        1. Go to [**StakeWise Solo**](https://v2.stakewise.io/solo) page and connect the wallet you used for registering the validators
        1. Ensure that all of your validator bills are paid
        1. Click on `Credentials change` button and download the file under the first step of "Change credentials using CLI". It will download a list of your validator indices and withdrawal credentials that is required for later.

        You should end up with a **text file** with two lists on two separate lines:

        1. Validator indices, each separated by comma (`Validator index list`)
        1. Withdrawal credentials, each separated by comma, matching the order of respective validator indices (`Withdrawal credentials list`)

        ## Download and Launch Ethereum Staking Deposit CLI

        1. Launch **Terminal** on your Mac and enter the following command to download the latest release of the `staking_deposit-cli` by StakeWise:

        ```
        curl -OL https://github.com/stakewise/staking-deposit-cli/releases/download/v2.5.1/staking_deposit-cli-e53772b-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
        ```

        :::custom-info[Note]
        This version of the `staking_deposit-cli` is based on the original `cli` by the Ethereum Foundation which was modified by StakeWise.
        You can track all the changes vs the original `cli` [here](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/compare/master...stakewise:staking-deposit-cli:master).
        :::

        2. Disconnect your Mac from the Internet / disable Internet at your location to prevent possible intereference with the next steps

        :::custom-warning[Important]

        :::

        8. Copy and paste the withdrawal address into the **Terminal** again when asked to repeat

        At this stage, you will have generated a `.json` file that can be found in the `staking_deposit-cli` folder.

        ## Broadcast the `.json` File Message to the Network

        1. Head to the [**Beacon Chain Explorer**](https://beaconcha.in/tools/broadcast) website
        2. Upload your `.json` file into the relevant form

        At this stage, your BLS withdrawal credentials should be changed to `0x01` withdrawal address to enable partial and full withdrawals for your Solo validators. Congratulations!

        :::custom-info[Note]
        If you are unsure whether the procedure was successful, in about 1 hour after the procedure visit `https://beaconcha.in/validator/[index]#withdrawals` by replacing `index` with your actual validator index (e.g., `https://beaconcha.in/validator/156849#withdrawals`).
