# Additional Actions

Running validators doesn't stop at registration — operators also need tools to add extra rewards and manage them efficiently. They must monitor performance, upgrade validators, and eventually exit them when required.

The StakeWise Operator Service includes a set of additional actions designed to make Vault management easier, more efficient, and more transparent.

With these tools, you can:

[Add extra rewards →](./add-extra-rewards) — allocate incentives directly to your Vault.

[Automate fee claiming →](./fee-claiming) — distribute rewards to shareholders based on the set percentages.

[Monitor performance →](./monitoring) — track metrics and rewards in real time with Prometheus and Grafana.

[Consolidate validators →](./consolidate-validators) — upgrade legacy validators for Pectra compatibility and reduce infrastructure overhead.

[Exit validators manually →](./manual-exit) — safely exit validators manually when needed.

[Recover validators →](./recover-validators) — recover validator keystores that are active.

[Rated Network Integration →](./rated-network) — track validator performance and analytics.

Dive into each action to see when it is useful and how to set it up in your environment.
