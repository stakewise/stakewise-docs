# Vault Performance

StakeWise provides performance grades (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Bad) to help users evaluate Vault quality based on validator operational excellence. These grades reflect the average Vault performance over the last 7 days. [View detailed grade criteria →](/operator/vault-performance#-performance-grades).

Performance grades help users identify well-operated Vaults but should be considered alongside other factors like fees, capacity, and operator reputation.
