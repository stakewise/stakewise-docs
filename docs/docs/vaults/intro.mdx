Vaults are isolated staking pools that process ETH and GNO deposits for staking, distribute rewards, and handle withdrawals in a trustless and non-custodial manner.

ETH and GNO deposits into any Vault can only be used to launch validators for that specific Vault. Any rewards (or penalties) accumulated by these validators will belong to the Vault.
This isolates each Vault, allowing depositors to customize their staking experience to their needs.

Individuals, professional node operators, DAOs, communities, and institutions can deploy a Vault to enable ETH and GNO staking on specific terms, like a bespoke staking fee, unique mix of operators, custom MEV strategy, capacity, branding, and optional ERC-20 Vault Token issuance.

All deposits, reward distribution, and withdrawals are handled by smart contracts, making staking in Vaults fully non-custodial.
