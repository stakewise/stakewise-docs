# HashiCorp Vault

The Operator supports loading signing keys from a remote [HashiCorp Vault ↗](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs) instance, avoiding storage of keystores on the filesystem. This approach is best suited for node operators who already have most of StakeWise Operator functionality implemented in their systems, and only need integration for validators registration or pooling support.

:::custom-warning[Advanced Users Only]
  Regular users should only employ this functionality on their own risk, if they already manage a deployment of HashiCorp Vault.
:::

## Prerequisites

Complete the following steps before proceeding:

:::custom-notes[Required Setup Steps]
  1. [Installation →](../Installation) completed
  2. [Operator Service →](../prepare-operator) prepared
  3. Validator keys stored in your [HashiCorp Vault ↗](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs) instance
:::

## Key Storage Format

The user must provide HashiCorp Vault instance URL, authentication token, and secret path in K/V engine.

Internal structure of the secret must resemble the following JSON format:
  ```json
{
  "pubkey1": "privkey1",
  "pubkey2": "privkey2",
  ...
}
```

Public and private signing keys must be stored in hex form, with or without `0x` prefix.

After loading keys from HashiCorp Vault, the operator behaves in the same way as if it had loaded them from keystores, no additional operations needed to support the integration.

## Start Operator Service

Passing following options to `start` command will enable loading validator signing keys from remote [HashiCorp Vault ↗](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).

:::custom-warning[Important]
Make sure keystores directory is empty before running this command, otherwise operator will prefer local keystores.
:::
```bash
./operator start \
  --network=mainnet
  --vault=0x834...F87Cf \
  --consensus-endpoints=https://consensus-node \
  --execution-endpoints=https://execution-node \
  --hashi-vault-url=https://hashi-vault:8200 \
  --hashi-vault-token=hvs.abcde \
  --hashi-vault-key-path=keystores1 \
  --hashi-vault-key-path=keystores2
```

### Configuration Options

  - **`--hashi-vault-url`** - The base URL of the vault service, e.g. `http://vault:8200`.
  - **`--hashi-vault-token`** - Authentication token for accessing Hashi vault
  - **`--hashi-vault-key-path`** - Key path(s) in the K/V secret engine where validator signing keys are stored
  - **`--hashi-vault-key-prefix`** - Key prefix(es) in the K/V secret engine under which validator signing keys are stored
