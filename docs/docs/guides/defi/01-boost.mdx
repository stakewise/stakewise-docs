# Boost Feature

## How Boost Works

StakeWise Boost enhances staking rewards by using osTokens as collateral to borrow additional assets on [Aave ↗](https://aave.com/). This borrowed capital is then staked again, creating a "looped" process that amplifies your staking position:

- **6x looping** in Vaults with 90% LTV
- **14x looping** in Vaults with 100% LTV
- **Up to 3x boost** in staking rewards compared to normal staking

The strategy extracts the difference between additional staking rewards and Aave borrowing costs, historically delivering 4-6% APY with peaks around 7%.

### Safety Mechanisms

:::custom-info[Liquidation Protection]
**Max LTV**: 93% - the maximum you can borrow against your osToken collateral

**Liquidation Threshold**: 95% - when positions become subject to liquidation

**Safety Buffer**: 2% - substantial protection before liquidation risk<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup>
:::

#### Price Stability Protection

Boost eliminates depeg-related liquidation risks through Aave's use of StakeWise's native price feed for osTokens instead of volatile secondary market prices. This means osToken price fluctuations on DEXs cannot trigger liquidations, as your collateral value always equals the osToken redemption value rather than market price. This design ensures that temporary market volatility doesn't endanger your boosted position.

#### Escape Hatch

As an additional safety layer, Boost includes an "escape hatch" mechanism that activates when positions approach the liquidation threshold. When any boosted position reaches 94.5% LTV, anyone in the community can trigger an automatic unboosting transaction to protect the user. The StakeWise core team actively monitors all boosted positions and will trigger these protective exits when necessary, with all funds always remaining under the original owner's control.

### How to Use Boost

:::custom-info[Prerequisites]
To use Boost, you need osTokens in your wallet. If you don't have any, see the [staking guide →](/docs/guides/staking) for instructions on minting osTokens from your stake.
:::

#### Boosting Process

1. Go to your Vault page and find the **"Boost"** section
2. Click plus **+** button to start the boost process
3. Use the input field to specify the amount of osTokens to boost
4. Confirm the boost transaction
5. View your boosted osETH balance and enhanced APY in Position changes

#### Unboosting Process

1. Go to your Vault page and find the **"Boost"** section
2. Click minus **-** button to start the unboost process
3. Use the input field to specify the amount of osTokens to unboost
4. Confirm the unboost transaction (enters unboost queue)
5. Monitor estimated processing time and claim assets when available

:::custom-warning[User Best Practices]
Monitor your position regularly and exit Boost if APY remains negative for more than 7 consecutive days. Stay connected with the StakeWise Discord community for real-time updates on market conditions.

  <span>1.</span> The 2% safety buffer provides substantial protection because, based on historical analysis of 420 days: LTV increases only ~10.7% of the time (39 days per year), with the longest negative streak being just 7 days during Genesis Vault validator rotation. Even in extreme scenarios where borrow rates consistently exceed osToken APY by 2%, liquidation would take over a year. For every 1 day of LTV increase, users benefit from 8 days of LTV decline, making positions progressively safer over time.
