# StakeWise DAO

<p style={{fontSize: '1.2em', color: '#6c757d', marginTop: '-10px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>Learn the basics of StakeWise DAO governance</p>

## Community-first approach

The sole purpose of StakeWise's existence is to make staking as seamless and profitable as possible.

Community feedback and adoption matter a lot for achieving this goal, and therefore StakeWise aims to create a cohesive community of stakers by putting the governance of the protocol in their hands.

## Role of the DAO

The DAO's job will be to govern the important system parameters like:

- fees paid by stakers,
- commissions paid to node operators,
- onboarding and offboarding of oracles and node operators,
- principles of liquidity mining campaigns,
- whitelisting of gauge contracts,
- Insurance Fund payout triggers,
- approval of contract changes for the introduction of new features, and more.

When choosing these parameters, the community will need to optimize for both its immediate interests as stakers and the long-term success of the protocol through a correct choice of parameters.
