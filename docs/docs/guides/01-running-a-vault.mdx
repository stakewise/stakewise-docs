# Running a Vault

This comprehensive guide walks you through creating your own StakeWise Vault step by step.

A [Vault →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Vaults) is a customizable smart contract that can be deployed by anyone to stake their own capital and/or offer staking to others, all in a non-custodial way.

Each Vault is isolated from others and relies on its own set of validators to produce rewards on the consensus layer. However, a Vault may participate in [MEV smoothing →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Vaults/#mev-strategy) to avoid volatility in the execution layer earnings.

Staked ETH/GNO in any Vault can be made liquid by minting [osETH/osGNO →](/docs/protocol-concepts/osToken) — a liquid staking token.

Choose your settings based on your intended use case:

| Use case | Recommended settings |
|----------|---------------------|
| 🏠 **Liquid solo staking** | • 0% fee • Private Vault • No Vault token • Smoothing Pool |
| 🌐 **Community staking pool** | • Custom capacity & fee • Public Vault • No Vault token • Smoothing Pool |
| 🏢 **Node operator service** | • Custom capacity & fee • Private Vault per customer • No Vault token • Smoothing Pool (compliance dependent) |
| 💎 **Service with custom LST** | • Custom capacity & fee • Public Vault • Enable Vault token • Smoothing Pool (compliance dependent) |
| 🔒 **Service without LST** | • Custom capacity & fee • Public Vault • No Vault token • Disable osToken access |

Below you'll find step-by-step instructions to create your Vault and get it running.

## How to create a Vault?

### Getting Started

:::custom-notes[Wallet Requirements]
You'll need an Ethereum wallet such as [Rabby Wallet ↗](https://rabby.io/).
The process will look very similar in other wallets.
:::

1. Navigate to the [StakeWise App ↗](https://app.stakewise.io) and go to the **"Operate"** section
2. Click the **"Create Vault"** button on the **"Operate your vault"** page to begin the setup process

### Step 1: Configure Vault Parameters

The first step involves setting up the fundamental parameters for your Vault.

:::custom-warning[Permanent Settings]
Most of these settings **cannot be changed later**. Choose carefully before proceeding.
:::

- **📐 Vault Capacity**: Set maximum ETH capacity (default: unlimited ∞). [Learn more →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Vaults#capacity)
- **💎 Vault Token** - Enable tradeable ERC-20 token (requires name & symbol)
- **🔑 Private Vault** - Restrict to approved wallets only
- **⚠️ Block List** - Prevent specific addresses from depositing

:::custom-info[Vault Fees]
**💰 Vault Fees** can be set during creation and updated later. [Learn more about fee management →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Fees#vault-fees)
:::

:::custom-warning[Required Acknowledgment]
You must check **"I understand that the parameters above cannot be changed later"** before proceeding.
:::

### Step 2: Block Rewards Destination

Choose how block rewards are distributed. This is a **permanent decision**.

Most operators choose [Smoothing Pool →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Vaults#smoothing-pool--pooled-rewards) for stable returns, while [Vault Escrow →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Vaults#own-escrow--own-rewards) gives you full control but with volatile rewards.

:::custom-warning[Required Acknowledgment]
You must check **"I understand that block rewards destination cannot be changed later"** before proceeding.
:::

### Step 3: Add Branding

Customize your Vault's appearance with name, description, and logo.

:::custom-notes[Branding Can Be Changed Later]
Unlike Vault parameters, you can update branding anytime via your Vault interface: press **Settings → Branding → Edit → Save**.
:::

### Step 4: Summary

Review all your settings before final submission. This is your last chance to verify everything is correct, such as name, type, MEV strategy, fees, and capacity.

:::custom-warning[Risk Acknowledgment]
You must check **"I understand the risks of operating the Vault and confirm my configuration choices"** before proceeding.
:::

Click **"Create Vault"** to submit your configuration and create the Vault.

### Step 5: Transaction Confirmation

Complete the blockchain transaction to deploy your Vault.

1. **Review Details**: Verify the transaction details in your wallet
2. **Confirm**: Click **"Confirm"** to submit the transaction
3. **Wait**: Transaction confirms ( ~12 sec )

Once the transaction confirms, your Vault is live and operational! 🎉

Your new Vault appears:
- ✅ Listed on the Operate page as "Your Name Vault"
- 📅 Shows creation date: "Created [date]"
- 🔧 Displays MEV strategy and Vault type

At the bottom of your Vault page, you'll see the **"Details"** section containing all the important information about your Vault.

:::custom-info[Next Steps After Creation]

**Set up validators** - Essential for Vault operation

**Reach out to the [StakeWise team 📧](mailto:info@stakewise.io)** for Vault verification (better visibility and trust with potential stakers)
:::

## Vault Administration

Once your Vault is created, you can manage all settings through the **"Settings"** button in the StakeWise interface.

### What You Can Control

<Tabs groupId="vault-settings">
  <TabItem value="branding" label="🎨 Branding" default>
    **Update anytime:**
    - 📝 Vault name
    - 📋 Description
    - 🖼️ Logo
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fees" label="💰 Fees">
    **Manage fees:**
    - Set rates: 0-100% of staking rewards
    - Update frequency: Once every 3 days, limited to 20% increase per update
    - Special case: If initial fee is 0%, first increase is limited to 1%
    - Configure multiple recipients with percentage splits
    - Enable automatic periodic claims
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="roles" label="👥 Roles">
    **Delegate permissions:**
    - **Admin**: Full Vault control
    - **Fee Claimer**: Claim fees for shareholders
    - **Validators Manager**: Authorize validator registrations, funding, and withdrawals ([Learn more →](/operator/validators-manager))
    - **Whitelist/Blocklist Manager**: Update accounts that can deposit (whitelist) or cannot deposit (blocklist). Only appears for Private Vaults or Vaults with blocklist functionality enabled
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Getting Your Vault Running

### Operator Service

To make your Vault operational and begin accepting stakes, you'll need to set up the [Operator Service →](/operator/intro) – specialized software that automates validator management for your Vault.

The Operator Service runs seamlessly alongside any node setup, supporting your preferred execution/consensus clients, MEV relay, and distributed validator technology. It handles critical functions like validator registrations, withdrawals, state updates, and fee claims, and can be installed via binary, Docker, or built from source.

**🚀 Setup difficulty:** Moderate - requires running Ethereum nodes and basic command-line familiarity, but the process is well-documented with [automated installation options →](/operator/installation) available.

:::custom-info[osETH Minting Thresholds]
Your Vault's performance and parameters determine how much osETH can be minted against staked assets. Learn more about [LTV thresholds and eligibility criteria →](/docs/protocol-concepts/osToken#ltv-threshold-settings).
