# DeFi

This chapter covers StakeWise features that integrate your staked assets with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to earn additional rewards.
Whether it's Boost, which amplifies staking returns by looping assets on Aave, or the SWISE-ETH liquidity pool, which lets you earn fees as a liquidity provider, these guides show how to put your assets to work beyond standard staking.

Explore this section to understand how DeFi features can enhance your yield while staying connected to the StakeWise ecosystem.
