# Staking into a Vault

When staking into a Vault, users deposit ETH or GNO and receive Vault shares representing their proportional ownership of the pool's assets. There are no minimum deposit requirements and no maximum limits except the Vault's capacity limit.

Vaults use a shares-based accounting system where:
- Shares are non-transferable (unless the Vault is an ERC-20 Vault)
- Shares may not appear in portfolio tracking applications
- Share value increases automatically as staking rewards accumulate
- No token swaps or conversions occur during staking

For immediate liquidity, users can mint osTokens (`osETH` or `osGNO`) using their Vault shares as collateral.
