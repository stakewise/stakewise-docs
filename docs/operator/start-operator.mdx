# Start Operator

After completing [Validators Manager →](validators-manager) setup, you're ready to start the Operator Service to begin automated validator registrations.

## Start Operator Service

You are ready to run the Operator Service using the `start` command, passing your Vault address and consensus and execution endpoints as flags.

:::custom-warning[Required Flags]
- `--vault` - Your Vault address
- `--consensus-endpoints` - Consensus client API endpoints
- `--execution-endpoints` - Execution client API endpoints
:::

There are several ways to run the Operator Service, depending on how you store private keys.

### Local Keystores

By default, the Operator Service runs with locally stored keystores created during key creation.

```bash
./operator start \
  --vault=0x834F27bC8670491b75af512d943f01D5383F87Cf \
  --consensus-endpoints=https://consensus-node \
  --execution-endpoints=https://execution-node
```



:::custom-info[External Key Management]
For alternative key management methods (Remote Signer, HashiCorp Vault, API Mode), see the [Alternative Key Management →](./alternative-key-management) section.
:::

### Running Options

Depending on your installation method, use the appropriate command format:

<Tabs groupId="installation-types">
  <TabItem value="binary" label="Binary" default>
    #### Using Binary

    ```bash
    ./operator start \
      --vault=0x834F27bC8670491b75af512d943f01D5383F87Cf \
      --consensus-endpoints=https://consensus-node \
      --execution-endpoints=https://execution-node
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
    #### Using Docker

    For Docker, you first need to mount the folder containing validator keystores and include the `--data-dir` flag alongside the `start` command:

    ```bash
    docker run --restart on-failure:10 \
    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v ~/.stakewise/:/data \
    europe-west4-docker.pkg.dev/stakewiselabs/public/v3-operator:v4.0.14 \
    src/main.py start-local \
    --vault=0x834F27bC8670491b75af512d943f01D5383F87Cf \
    --data-dir=/data \
    --consensus-endpoints=http://localhost:5052 \
    --execution-endpoints=http://localhost:8545
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="source" label="Source Files">
    #### Using Source Files

    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python src/main.py start-local \
    --vault=0x834F27bC8670491b75af512d943f01D5383F87Cf \
    --consensus-endpoints=http://localhost:5052 \
    --execution-endpoints=http://localhost:8545
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Optional Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <nobr>`--keystores-dir`</nobr> | The directory with validator keys in the [EIP-2335 ↗](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335) standard. Required if you didn't use Operator Service to generate keys. The folder must contain either a single `password.txt` password file for all keystores or separate password files for each keystore with the same name as keystore, but ending with `.txt` (e.g., `keystore1.json`, `keystore1.txt`) |
| <nobr>`--keystores-password-file`</nobr> | Absolute path to the password file for decrypting keystores. Required if you didn't use Operator Service to generate keys |
| <nobr>`--wallet-file`</nobr> | Path to the wallet keystore file. Required if you are using an existing wallet instead of the Operator Service generated wallet |
| <nobr>`--wallet-password-file`</nobr> | Path to the password file for the wallet keystore. Required if you are using an existing wallet |
| <nobr>`--verbose`</nobr> | Enable debug mode, prints full output on error |
| <nobr>`--log-level`</nobr> | Logging detail level, value can be one of: 'ERROR', 'WARNING', 'INFO', 'DEBUG' |
| <nobr>`--min-deposit-amount-gwei`</nobr> | The minimum amount (in Gwei) that must accumulate in the Vault to trigger validator registration or a top-up. Default: 10,000,000,000 Gwei (10 ETH/GNO) |
| <nobr>`--vault-min-balance-gwei`</nobr> | The amount of assets (ETH/GNO) in Gwei that should be kept in the vault and not sent for staking. Default: 0 |
| <nobr>`--max-validator-balance-gwei`</nobr> | The maximum balance (in Gwei) a validator can have before it is no longer eligible for top-ups. Default: 1945000000000 Gwei (1945 ETH) for Ethereum, 1800000000000 Gwei (1800 mGNO) for Gnosis |
| <nobr>`--max-withdrawal-request-fee-gwei`</nobr> | The maximum fee (in Gwei) for submitting a withdrawal request per validator. Default: 1000 Gwei |
| <nobr>`--min-deposit-delay`</nobr> | The minimum delay that must pass between validator registration or top-up transactions. Adjust this to control the frequency of registration transactions. Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour) |
| <nobr>`--max-fee-per-gas-gwei`</nobr> | The maximum fee per gas for transactions. Adjust it if you want to limit the maximum gas fee you're willing to pay. Default: 10 Gwei for Ethereum, 2 Gwei for Gnosis |
| <nobr>`--validator-type`</nobr> | Set to `0x01` if you want to register `0x01` validators. Default: `0x02` validators are registered |
| <nobr>`--harvest-vault`</nobr> | Keeps your Vault synced by calling the `updateState` function of the Vault contract every 12 hours. This simplifies contract interactions and reduces gas costs for your users. By default, the Vault state is also updated whenever users interact with the Vault (deposits, withdrawals, etc.) |
| <nobr>`--claim-fee-splitter`</nobr> | Claims fees periodically to the addresses of the shareholders. See [Fee Claiming →](./additional-actions/fee-claiming) for details |
| <nobr>`--disable-withdrawals`</nobr> | Disables submitting partial and full withdrawals. This reduces gas costs but increases withdrawal times for users. Oracles will instead submit the exit signatures received from the Operator Service during validator registration |
| <nobr>`--disable-validators-registration`</nobr> | Disables registering new validators |
| <nobr>`--disable-validators-funding`</nobr> | Disables topping up existing `0x02` validators |
| <nobr>`--concurrency`</nobr> | Number of CPU cores used to both load and create keystores |

:::custom-tips[Performance Optimization]
For optimal performance, set `--concurrency` to half your CPU cores (e.g., `--concurrency=4` for 8-core systems) to prevent overloading during keystore operations.

:::custom-notes[Setup Complete]
Congratulations 🎉! Your Operator Service is now running and ready to trigger validator registrations within your Vault. Monitor the logs to ensure validators are being registered successfully.
