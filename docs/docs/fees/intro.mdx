# Fees

## Introduction

StakeWise acts as middleware between stakers and node operators.

The fee structure ensures sustainable protocol development while maintaining competitive returns for users and fair compensation for Vault operators.

## Vault Fees

A Vault fee is a percentage fee charged by Vault operators on staking rewards.
This fee varies by Vault operator and can range **from 0% to 100%**.

The fee is automatically deducted from staking rewards when the Vault state is updated and is transferred to the Vault's designated fee recipient (typically the Vault operator).

The fee is a **dynamic parameter** set during the Vault creation process.
Importantly, fees can only be increased by **20% at a time** (e.g., from 5% to 6%) with **a 3-day delay** between updates.
If the current fee is 0%, it cannot exceed 1% initially.
The Vault must be "harvested" (state updated) before fee changes take effect.

The StakeWise DAO does not charge Vault creators or stakers for using Vaults.

:::custom-tips[Quick Tip]
The fee level for a given Vault can be found in the *Details* at the bottom of the Vault page. Different Vaults have different fees (e.g., 5%, 4.2%, 100%, 3.5%, etc).

## osToken Fees

StakeWise DAO charges a **5% fee** on the rewards accumulated by osETH, and continuously applies the fee to the balance of osETH a user must return to the Vault.
The fee is charged in osETH, meaning that the amount of osETH a user must return to the Vault constantly increases in proportion to the fee.

:::custom-notes[How It Works: Fee to osETH Conversion]
For example, if a user's stake has accumulated **1 ETH in rewards**, StakeWise will apply a **0.05 ETH fee** to their osETH balance using the current exchange rate.

At an exchange rate of **1.05 ETH/osETH**, the fee corresponds to:

$$
{\small \frac{0.05}{1.05} = 0.047619\ \text{osETH}}
$$

Thus, the user's total minted osETH balance increases by **0.0476 osETH**.

:::custom-notes[Example: Alice's Annual Fee Impact]
Alice stakes **10 ETH** in a Vault with a **5% Vault fee**.

- Her validator earns **0.4 ETH** in rewards over a year
- Vault fee: `0.4 Ã— 5% = 0.02 ETH`
- Direct rewards received: **0.38 ETH**

**If Alice had minted osETH:**
- Additional 5% osETH fee would apply to rewards
- Fee goes to DAO Treasury
- Net rewards after both fees: **0.361 ETH**

:::custom-warning[Additional Network Costs]
Vault operators should also be aware of network-related fees required for Beacon Chain operations such as validator registration.
These fees are paid directly to the Ethereum network and are separate from StakeWise protocol fees.
