# Automated Node Setup

:::custom-warning[Experimental Feature]
The automated node setup is an experimental feature that simplifies Reth and Lighthouse installation. It is functional and actively maintained, but still being refined.
:::

## Prerequisites

You must have the following steps completed before using automated node setup:
- Deployed a StakeWise Vault. See the [Deployed Vault →](Prerequisites#deployed-vault) section in Prerequisites.
- Generated and stored validator keys. See the [Validator Keys →](validator-keys) section in Validator Keys.
- Configured the Validators Manager. See the [Validators Manager →](validators-manager) section in Validators Manager.

The Operator Service includes built-in commands to automatically install and manage [Reth ↗](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) (execution) and [Lighthouse ↗](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) (consensus) clients.
## Workflow

1. Run `node-install --network=mainnet` to download Reth and Lighthouse
2. Run `node-start --vault=YOUR_VAULT` to start syncing
3. Run `node-status --vault=YOUR_VAULT` to monitor sync progress

## `node-install`

Installs Reth and Lighthouse binaries to the data directory.

```bash
./operator node-install --network=mainnet
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--network` | Network for your vault: `mainnet`, `hoodi`, or `gnosis` (required) |
| `--data-dir` | Path where node data will be placed. Default: `~/.stakewise` |
| `--lighthouse-version` | Lighthouse version to install. Default: `v8.0.0` |
| `--reth-version` | Reth version to install. Default: `v1.8.2` |

## `node-start`

Starts execution, consensus, and validator nodes.

```bash
./operator node-start \
  --vault=0x834F27bC8670491b75af512d943f01D5383F87Cf
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--vault` | Your Vault contract address (required) |
| `--data-dir` | Path where node data will be placed. Default: `~/.stakewise` |
| `--print-execution-logs` | Print execution node logs |
| `--print-consensus-logs` | Print consensus node logs |
| `--print-validator-logs` | Print validator node logs |
| `--no-confirm` | Skip confirmation messages |

## `node-status`

Displays sync status of execution and consensus clients, plus validator information.

```bash
./operator node-status \
  --vault=0x834F27bC8670491b75af512d943f01D5383F87Cf
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--vault` | Your Vault contract address (required) |
| `--data-dir` | Path where node data is located. Default: `~/.stakewise` |
| `--output-format` | Output format: `text` or `json`. Default: `text` |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable debug mode |
| `--enable-file-logging` | Log output to file in nodes directory |
