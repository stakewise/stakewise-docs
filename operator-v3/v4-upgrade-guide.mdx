# V4 Upgrade Guide

This guide covers the key changes and upgrade steps for StakeWise Operator V4, including support for the Pectra upgrade (activated on 07-May-2025 at epoch 364032).

:::custom-info[Prerequisites]
Ensure your Vault is updated to **version 5** for Ethereum network or **version 3** for Gnosis network for full Pectra compatibility. See [Prerequisites →](./Prerequisites#deployed-vault) for details on checking and upgrading your Vault version.

Additionally, ensure your Operator Service wallet has the [Validators Manager →](/operator/validators-manager#step-2-assign-validators-manager-role) role assigned in your Vault settings for proper operation.
:::

## Validator Changes
### Registration
After the Pectra upgrade ([EIP-7251 ↗](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251)):
- **Validator balances are no longer limited** to 32 ETH or 1 GNO (now up to 2048 ETH or 64 GNO)
- **`0x02` validators are registered by default**
- To register `0x01` validators, add the flag `--validators-type=0x01`

:::custom-notes[Consolidations]
To migrate `0x01` validators to `0x02`, use the `consolidate` command. Read more about it [here →](/operator/additional-actions/consolidate-validators).
:::

When funding validators:
1. Funds first **top up existing `0x02` validators** up to 2048 ETH or 64 GNO before registering new validators
2. **New validators are registered** once the Vault accumulates another 32 ETH or 1 GNO

:::custom-warning[Note]
Funding will be disabled when using `0x01` validator type.
:::

### Withdrawals

The Pectra upgrade introduces significantly improved withdrawal mechanisms:

#### Partial Withdrawals (New!)
- Supported for **`0x02` validators only**, enabling withdrawal of excess balance **without exiting the validator**
- **Automated execution every 12 hours** by default (configurable via `WITHDRAWALS_INTERVAL` environment variable)
- Triggers partial withdrawals for validators with **balances exceeding 32 ETH or 1 GNO**, prioritizing those with higher balances first
- Significantly faster than full validator exits, improving withdrawal queue processing times

#### More Efficient Full Validator Exits
- **Full validator exits** are now processed via **execution layer triggerable exits** ([EIP-7002 ↗](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002)) instead of the traditional oracle-based method
- **Automatic fallback**: If the Operator Service does not initiate partial or full withdrawals, the Oracle network will automatically execute a full withdrawal after 24 hours using the exit signatures they have received during validator registration

:::custom-info[Withdrawal Logic & Prioritization]
When processing withdrawal requests:

1. **First Priority**: Partial withdrawals from `0x02` validators with excess balance (>32 ETH/1 GNO)
2. **Second Priority**: Full validator exits if partial withdrawal capacity is insufficient
3. **Fallback**: Oracle-triggered full exits after 24 hours if operator is inactive
:::

:::custom-notes[Configuration Options]
- **Disable partial withdrawals**: Use `--disable-withdrawals` flag to process all withdrawals via full validator exits using oracles
- **Adjust frequency**: Set `WITHDRAWALS_INTERVAL` environment variable to change the default 12-hour interval
- **Minimum thresholds**: Partial withdrawals only occur when validator balance exceeds 32 ETH or 1 GNO
:::

:::custom-warning[Important for `0x01` Validators]
Partial withdrawals are **not supported** for `0x01` validators. These will always require full validator exits for withdrawals.

## Simplified Start Commands

The launch process has been simplified by separating setup flows into dedicated commands:

```bash
# No changes needed for default mode
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="remote" label="Remote Signer">

```bash
start-remote-signer

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::custom-notes[Reference]
For detailed information about start commands, see [Start Operator Service →](./start-operator).
:::

## No More Deposit Data File

V4 Operator **no longer requires pre-uploaded deposit data** for validator registration — it generates deposit data automatically during registration.

:::custom-info[Important]
To support this new flow, you must **assign your operator wallet as the Validators Manager** in the Vault settings.

🔗 **Setup Guide**: [How to Set Up Validators Manager →](/operator/validators-manager).
:::

## Automated Rewards Withdrawals

It is now possible to **periodically withdraw rewards** for the Vault's fee shareholders.

:::custom-notes[Deep Dive]
For detailed instructions on fee claiming, see [Fee Claiming →](/operator/additional-actions/fee-claiming).
