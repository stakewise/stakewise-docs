# DVT setup components

## DVT cluster of distributed validators
Performs validator duties

## StakeWise Operator
StakeWise [operator ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-operator) registers validators in Vault contract.
Operator doesn’t have access to validator keystores.

## DVT Relayer
DVT [relayer ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/dvt-relayer) is a service providing validators' registration data to Stakewise Operator in DVT setup.
It specifically handles validators whose private keys were generated through distributed key generation (DKG) procedures.
In production environments, the DVT relayer should not have access to DV keystores.

## DVT sidecars
DVT [sidecar ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/dvt-operator-sidecar) is a service that works in conjunction with DVT-relayer and which should be running on each DVT operator in DVT cluster.
DVT sidecar loads DV keystores, polls validator exits from Relayer, and pushes exit signature shares to Relayer on behalf of DVT operators.
