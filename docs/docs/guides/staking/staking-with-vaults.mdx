# How to stake with Vaults?

## Understanding Vault Staking

Vault staking gives you control over exactly how your assets are staked. Unlike one-click staking, you can choose specific node operators, MEV strategies, and fee structures that match your preferences.

:::custom-notes[Why Choose Vault Staking?]
**Higher potential yields** – Access to specialized operators and strategies

**Custom terms** – Choose fee rates, node operators, and MEV handling

**Isolated rewards** – Earn from your chosen Vault's performance only

**Slashing protection** – Protected from penalties in other Vaults
:::

1. **Navigate to Vaults** from the StakeWise homepage and connect your wallet
2. **Browse available Vaults** using filters for performance, APY, and TVL
3. **Select your Vault** and review its APY, operator info, fees, and capacity
4. **Click "Stake"** and enter the amount you want to stake
5. **Review terms** and confirm the transaction in your wallet


## Making Your Stake Liquid (Optional)

After staking in a Vault, you can mint osTokens against your stake to maintain liquidity:

1. **Access Mint Option**: On your Vault's page, find the **"Mint osToken"** section
2. **Choose Amount**: Use the slider or enter the amount of osTokens to mint
   - Maximum: 90% of your stake (99.99% for selected Vaults)
   - Your full staking rewards continue regardless of minting ratio

3. **Complete Minting**: Confirm the transaction to receive osTokens
4. **Monitor Health**: Keep track of your position health in the Vault interface

:::custom-info[Position Health]
Your osToken position has health levels (Healthy, Moderate, Risky, Unhealthy) based on your Vault's performance relative to osTokens. Monitor this to avoid liquidation. [Learn more →](/docs/ostoken/how-ostoken-works#position-health)

## Vault Staking Management

Once staked in a Vault, you can:

- **📈 Track Performance**: Monitor your Vault's APY and your earned rewards
- **🔄 Mint/Burn osTokens**: Adjust your liquid staking position as needed ([Learn about minting →](/docs/ostoken/how-ostoken-works#minting) | [Learn about burning →](/docs/ostoken/how-ostoken-works#burning))
- **⚡ Use Boost**: Increase your staking rewards with additional yield opportunities
- **📤 Unstake**: Exit the Vault (requires burning all minted osTokens first)
- **💱 Switch Vaults**: Unstake from one and stake in another for better terms
