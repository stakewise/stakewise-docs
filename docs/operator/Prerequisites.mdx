# Prerequisites

Before installing and configuring the Operator Service, your node infrastructure must meet specific technical requirements to ensure reliable operation.

## Execution Client

Your execution node must be fully synced and running.
Any execution client that supports the [ETH Execution API specification 竊余(https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/) can be used:

<Tabs groupId="execution-clients">
  <TabItem value="nethermind" label="Nethermind" default>
    **[Nethermind 竊余(https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/nethermind)** - Supports both Ethereum and Gnosis networks

    Standard installation and configuration. No special requirements.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="besu" label="Besu">
    **Besu** - Ethereum network support

    Standard installation and configuration. No special requirements.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="erigon" label="Erigon">
    **Erigon** - Supports both Ethereum and Gnosis networks

    :::warning Special Configuration Required
    Event logs must be preserved for the Operator Service to function properly:

    ```bash
    # Ethereum Mainnet
    erigon --prune=receipts --prune.to=21471500

    # For other networks, adjust block number to Keeper contract creation block
    ```

    The required flags prevent event log pruning that the Operator reads from certain contracts.

    Standard installation and configuration. No special requirements.

  <TabItem value="reth" label="Reth">
    **Reth** - Ethereum network support

    Standard installation and configuration. Ensure proper event log retention (consult Reth documentation for specific configurations).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Consensus Client

Your consensus node must be fully synced and running.
Any consensus client that supports [ETH Beacon Node API specification 竊余(https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/) can be used:

<Tabs groupId="consensus-clients">
  <TabItem value="lighthouse" label="Lighthouse" default>
    **Lighthouse** - Supports both Ethereum and Gnosis networks
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nimbus" label="Nimbus">
    **Nimbus** - Supports both Ethereum and Gnosis networks
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="prysm" label="Prysm">
    **Prysm** - Ethereum network support
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="teku" label="Teku">
    **Teku** - Supports both Ethereum and Gnosis networks
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="lodestar" label="Lodestar">
    **Lodestar** - Supports both Ethereum and Gnosis networks
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Validator Configuration
Configure your validator clients with the correct **fee recipient address**, which can be found in your Vault's Details section on the StakeWise interface.
:::

## Deployed Vault

You must have an active StakeWise Vault deployed and ready for operation.

### Creating a New Vault

  If you don't have a Vault yet, follow these steps:

  1. **Visit the StakeWise Interface**
     - Go to the [StakeWise Operate page](https://stakewise.io/operate)
     - Connect your wallet using the button in the upper right corner

  2. **Create Your Vault**
     - Click "Create Vault"
     - Configure Vault parameters (these cannot be changed later):
       - **Capacity**: Set maximum staking limits
       - **Fee Structure**: Define your operator fees
       - **Vault Token**: Choose whether to issue a Vault-specific token
       - **Access Type**: Set as Public or Private

  3. **Choose MEV Settings**
     - Decide on Smoothing Pool participation
     - This choice cannot be changed after deployment

  4. **Add Vault Branding**
     - Specify Vault name, logo, and description
     - This helps users identify your Vault

  5. **Deploy**
     - Review all settings in the summary
     - Click "Create Vault" and confirm the transaction

  ### Finding Your Vault Address

  Once your Vault is deployed, you'll need its contract address for Operator Service configuration:

  <Tabs groupId="vault-address-methods">
    <TabItem value="url" label="From URL" default>
      **Method 1: URL Bar**

      Navigate to your Vault page - the address is visible in the URL:
      ```
      https://stakewise.io/vault/mainnet/0x1234567890abcdef...
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                          Your Vault Address
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="details" label="From Details Section">
      **Method 2: Vault Details**

      1. Go to your Vault page
      2. Scroll to the bottom to find the "Details" section
      3. Look for "Contract address" field
      4. Copy the displayed address
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

  :::important Save Your Vault Address
  Keep your Vault address safe - you'll need it for all Operator Service configurations throughout the setup process.
