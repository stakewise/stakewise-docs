# The StakeWise Protocol

## Introduction

StakeWise is a liquid staking protocol for Ethereum, designed to make staking more flexible, secure, and accessible.

Rather than consisting of one large staking pool, StakeWise has a network of permissionless, customizable, and non-custodial staking pools deployed by various service providers,
allowing individuals and organizations to pick which nodes will stake their ETH, helping them find the most suitable staking arrangement.
All pools offer on-demand liquidity and DeFi integrations for users' stake via osToken, providing the flexibility to get the token only when needed.

The protocol is implemented as a mix of both upgradable (via dual governance) smart contracts that must keep up with the changes in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake specification,
and persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts designed to prioritize security and self-custody, and to function without centralized intermediaries who may selectively restrict access to the service.

StakeWise was formally introduced with the release of its [Litepaper in 2022 ↗](https://www.stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf),
which set out the vision for a modular staking protocol designed to counter centralization risks and expand user choice.
Since then, the protocol has continued to evolve to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi,
specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive.

Most users lack either the technical expertise to run validator nodes or the 32 ETH required to stake.
StakeWise addresses this by providing an essential base layer that lowers both technical and capital barriers to ETH staking.

## Understanding Liquid Staking

### What is Staking?

Staking is a <Tooltip content={<><strong>Cryptoeconomic mechanism</strong> <br /> A cryptoeconomic mechanism is a combination of cryptographic proof with economic incentives to govern the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in a decentralized digital economy.</>}>cryptoeconomic mechanism</Tooltip> that uses rewards and penalties to incentivize proper network behavior,
thereby enhancing the underlying security. In proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum, participants run
<Tooltip content={<><strong>Validator</strong> <br /> A <a href="./glossary#node" className="tooltip-link">node</a> in a proof-of-stake system responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
The primary identifier of a validator is its public BLS key (example of usage of the pubkey as an identifier is <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/0d90135047519f4c2ee586d50e560f7bb2ff9b10/account_manager/src/validator/exit.rs#L277-L280" className="tooltip-link">here</a>).

Validators are essential to maintaining network consensus — the process by which all participants agree on the blockchain's new global state<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1">1</a></sup>.

One of the important fields of the [validator object ↗](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/0d90135047519f4c2ee586d50e560f7bb2ff9b10/consensus/types/src/validator.rs#L26-L36)
is the <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f4f4f4', color: '#018970', padding: '2px 4px', borderRadius: '3px', fontFamily: 'monospace'}}>effective_balance</code><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2">2</a></sup>,
which represents the validator's "active" balance and determines its influence in the protocol.
This balance serves as the validator's "weight" in consensus duties, which are:

- Attesting to its view of the chain<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3">3</a></sup>
- Proposing beacon chain blocks
- Signing off on blocks in the <Tooltip content={<><strong>Sync Committee</strong> <br /> A sync committee is a special subset of 512 validators chosen pseudorandomly during each "sync committee period" (~1 day). These validators continually sign new Beacon block headers, enabling light clients "outside" the Beacon Chain to verify the consensus state with significantly reduced complexity.</>}>sync committees</Tooltip>
that support <Tooltip content={<><strong>Light Client</strong> <br /> A light client is a streamlined way to verify Ethereum's consensus state without running a full node. Instead of performing complex verification checks, light clients rely on sync committees to provide cryptographically verifiable summaries of the Beacon Chain head using just a few public keys and a single aggregated signature.</>}>light clients</Tooltip>

The Beacon Chain uses both rewards and penalties to incentivize proper validator behavior<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4">4</a></sup>.
Reward amounts are calculated based on mathematical formulas considering multiple variables, participation rates, timing, and network conditions<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5">5</a></sup>.
Validators also earn rewards from priority fees and MEV (Maximum Extractable Value).

### The Traditional Staking Dilemma
Traditional PoS staking follows a simple premise: lock tokens and earn rewards.
While this model secures the network, it has a major drawback — staked ETH is illiquid.
Once staked, it cannot be used elsewhere in decentralized finance (DeFi).
This creates a fundamental dilemma: stakers must choose between earning rewards and keeping their ETH liquid, but never both.


### Solution

Liquid staking transforms your stake into a tradeable asset through tokenization. When you stake through a liquid staking protocol, you receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) representing your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards. Unlike native staking where tokens are locked, LSTs remain liquid and <Tooltip content={<><strong>Composable</strong> <br /> In DeFi, composability refers to the ability of different protocols and applications to work together seamlessly, like building blocks. Composable tokens can be integrated across multiple DeFi protocols simultaneously, allowing users to leverage their assets in various ways at once.</>}>composable</Tooltip>. This unlocks the entire DeFi ecosystem while your original stake continues earning validation rewards. You can now earn from multiple sources:

- Staking rewards from your underlying validators;
- DeFi yields from a multitude of opportunities: collateral for lending, yield farming strategies, or trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs);

… while keeping your stake transferable and easily convertible back into ETH.

Liquid staking represents an epistemic shift in how staking works. With LSTs, you maintain exposure to staking rewards while having liquidity, breaking the disjunctive premise of traditional staking.

### Staking Options
In order to participate in the Ethereum consensus mechanism, a staker must deposit 32 ETH.

The default way to stake — called solo staking — can be prohibitive because of the minimum required 32 ETH and the technical expertise required to run a node. This accessibility barrier led to the emergence of staking service providers that require no programming knowledge or hardware setup: staking-as-a-service (SaaS) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). However, both come with significant concessions: SaaS providers still require the full 32 ETH minimum and offer no liquidity benefits, while centralized exchanges have one fundamental flaw — centralization, which contradicts crypto's core decentralization principles.

Decentralized liquid staking protocols emerged as a response — they don’t have a deposit minimum, instead “pooling” capital from many depositors, and issuing tokens that represent depositors’ share of the staking pool. These tokens are typically tradable on decentralized exchanges and are accepted as collateral in lending protocols, enabling frictionless entry and exit from staking, as well as participation in DeFi.

By nature of their service, liquid staking protocols are non-custodial and permissionless. However, their weakness is the standardized nature of the service — users don’t have the flexibility to control how and on what terms their assets are staked, and must always stake ETH on third-party nodes to access liquidity, commingling assets with other depositors. Such protocols also mostly rely on opaque node operator sets, often creating centralization around dominant node operators and leaving participants without transparency about stake allocation.

This opens room for an innovative approach to liquid staking pioneered by StakeWise.

## What is StakeWise?
StakeWise is a liquid staking protocol that gives you the benefits of permissionless and non-custodial liquid staking without the trade-offs.

Operating across Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, StakeWise creates a comprehensive staking network that serves diverse participants through three distinct approaches:

**[Vaults →](./protocol-concepts/Vaults)**: For advanced users seeking full control, choose from diverse staking pool offerings with distinct fee structures, MEV strategies, and risk profiles, empowering you to easily earn staking yields with complete control over your assets and validator selection. Instant liquidity and DeFi integrations are available on-demand by opting to receive osToken when staking.

**[One-click staking →](./guides/staking#how-to-stake-with-one-click)**: For users who want to start earning immediately without thinking twice, go for streamlined staking that automatically allocates your stake across proven Vaults that minimize fees and maximize your yield. osToken is issued automatically, granting access to instant liquidity and DeFi by default.

**[Run own Vault →](./guides/running-a-vault)**: For users and organizations that seek to run their own nodes to access liquidity for their stake, or offer a staking service to others, Vaults allow you to set up isolated, non-custodial, and customizable staking environments that preserve optional access to liquidity via osToken. Vaults already handle billions of US dollars worth of staked assets, powering solutions from [MetaMask ↗](https://metamask.io/), [Chorus One ↗](https://chorus.one/), [Blockchain.com ↗](http://Blockchain.com), [Ledger Live ↗](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live), and others.

StakeWise also continuously develops innovative strategies to maximize your rewards, such as [Boost →](./guides/defi/boost), with more features coming soon.

### Architecture
StakeWise's modular architecture is built on three foundational pillars: Vaults, osToken, and Oracles.

#### Vaults — Customizable Smart Contracts
Vaults are isolated, highly customizable smart contracts that function as individual staking pools.
Pool operators can accept deposits from stakers, earn fees, and offer tailored staking services.
This open marketplace model democratizes liquid staking, giving you the freedom to choose how and where to stake.

**Key Features**

- **Permissionless & Customizable**: Launch your own Vault without approval, control fees, MEV strategies, and validator selection. Make your Vault private or <Tooltip content={<><strong>OFAC-compliant</strong> <br /> Compliance with the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, which may restrict access to certain jurisdictions or sanctioned entities.</>}>OFAC-compliant</Tooltip>.

- **Open Marketplace**: Choose from diverse Vaults based on your preferences for decentralization, yield, or specialized strategies.

- **Risk Isolation**: Each Vault operates independently — issues in one do not affect others.

#### osToken — Overcollateralized Staking Token
osToken is StakeWise's liquid staking token: osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain.
Designed with safety and composability at its core, osToken accrues staking rewards while maintaining full liquidity for DeFi participation.
It can be minted by staking in Vaults or acquired directly on a DEX to start earning rewards instantly.

**Key Features**

- **Protected & Rewarding**: Overcollateralized by design, with auto-compounding rewards and integrated slashing protection.

- **DeFi Ready**: Fully composable and compatible with lending, trading, and yield-farming protocols.

#### Oracles — Decentralized Infrastructure Layer
The decentralized Oracle network connects StakeWise smart contracts to Ethereum's <Tooltip content={<><strong>Beacon Chain</strong> <br /> Ethereum's consensus layer, a peer-to-peer network of consensus clients that handles block gossip and consensus logic. It is responsible for things like block and attestation handling, running the fork choice algorithm, and managing rewards and penalties for validators.</>}>Beacon Chain</Tooltip>, enabling transparent and trustless operations while preserving the protocol's security and non-custodial design.

**Key Functions**

- **Validator Lifecycle**: Manages validator registration, consolidations, rewards, penalties, and exits.

- **Token Stability**: Maintains accurate osToken exchange rates and safeguards peg stability. [Learn more →](./protocol-concepts/osToken#reward-accrual--fee-mechanism)

  Users submit transactions to the network of nodes, and the goal of the consensus protocol is that all correct nodes eventually agree on a single, consistent view of the history of transactions. That is, the order in which transactions were processed and the outcome of that processing.

  Unlike the actual balance (which changes with every block), effective balance updates only once per epoch. It also "snaps" to the nearest 1 ETH increment due to a mechanism called hysteresis — this prevents constant fluctuations from affecting consensus calculations.

  Each attestation contains three votes: a source checkpoint vote, a target checkpoint vote (both for Casper FFG finality), and a head block vote (for [LMD-GHOST ↗](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/consensus/lmd_ghost/) fork choice).

  Validators earn rewards for contributing to chain security and face penalties for failing to contribute. Receiving a penalty is not the same as being slashed. Being slashed is a severe punishment for very specific misbehaviours (that could potentially be part of an attack on the chain), and results in the validator being ejected from the protocol in addition to some or all of its stake being removed. Penalties are subtracted from validators' balances on the Beacon Chain and effectively burned, so they reduce the net issuance of the Beacon Chain.
