# How to Create a Vault

### Getting Started

:::custom-notes[Wallet Requirements]
You'll need an Ethereum wallet such as [Rabby Wallet ↗](https://rabby.io/).
The process will look very similar in other wallets.
:::

1. Navigate to the [StakeWise App ↗](https://app.stakewise.io) and go to the **"Operate"** section
2. Click the **"Create Vault"** button on the **"Operate your vault"** page to begin the setup process

### Step 1: Configure Vault Parameters

The first step involves setting up the fundamental parameters for your Vault.

:::custom-warning[Permanent Settings]
Most of these settings **cannot be changed later**. Choose carefully before proceeding.
:::

- **📐 Vault Capacity** – Set maximum ETH capacity (default: unlimited ∞). [Learn more →](/docs/vaults/customization#capacity)
- **💎 Vault Token** – Enable tradeable ERC-20 token (requires name & symbol)
- **🔑 Private Vault** – Restrict to approved wallets only
- **⚠️ Block List** – Prevent specific addresses from depositing

:::custom-info[Vault Fees]
**💰 Vault Fees** can be set during creation and updated later. [Learn more about fee management →](/docs/fees/intro#vault-fees)
:::

:::custom-warning[Required Acknowledgment]
You must check **"I understand that the parameters above cannot be changed later"** before proceeding.
:::

### Step 2: Block Rewards Destination

Choose how block rewards are distributed. This is a **permanent decision**.

Most operators choose [Smoothing Pool →](/docs/vaults/customization#smoothing-pool--pooled-rewards) for stable returns, while [Vault Escrow →](/docs/vaults/customization#own-escrow--own-rewards) gives you full control but with volatile rewards.

:::custom-warning[Required Acknowledgment]
You must check **"I understand that block rewards destination cannot be changed later"** before proceeding.
:::

### Step 3: Add Branding

Customize your Vault's appearance with name, description, and logo.

:::custom-notes[Branding Can Be Changed Later]
Unlike Vault parameters, you can update branding anytime via your Vault interface: press **Settings → Branding → Edit → Save**.
:::

### Step 4: Summary

Review all your settings before final submission. This is your last chance to verify everything is correct, such as name, type, MEV strategy, fees, and capacity.

:::custom-warning[Risk Acknowledgment]
You must check **"I understand the risks of operating the Vault and confirm my configuration choices"** before proceeding.
:::

Click **"Create Vault"** to submit your configuration and create the Vault.

### Step 5: Transaction Confirmation

Complete the blockchain transaction to deploy your Vault.

1. **Review Details**: Verify the transaction details in your wallet
2. **Confirm**: Click **"Confirm"** to submit the transaction
3. **Wait**: Transaction confirms (~12 sec)

Once the transaction confirms, your Vault is live and operational! 🎉

Your new Vault appears:
- ✅ Listed on the Operate page as "Your Name Vault"
- 📅 Shows creation date: "Created [date]"
- 🔧 Displays MEV strategy and Vault type

At the bottom of your Vault page, you'll see the **"Details"** section containing all the important information about your Vault.
