# Running a Vault

This comprehensive guide walks you through creating your own StakeWise Vault step by step.

A [Vault →](/docs/vaults/intro) is a customizable smart contract that can be deployed by anyone to stake their own capital and/or offer staking to others, all in a non-custodial way.

Each Vault is isolated from others and relies on its own set of validators to produce rewards on the consensus layer. However, a Vault may participate in [MEV smoothing →](/docs/vaults/customization#mev-strategy) to avoid volatility in the execution layer earnings.

Staked ETH/GNO in any Vault can be made liquid by minting [osETH/osGNO →](/docs/ostoken/intro) – a liquid staking token.

Choose your settings based on your intended use case:

| Use case | Recommended settings |
|----------|---------------------|
| 🏠 **Liquid solo staking** | • 0% fee • Private Vault • No Vault token • Smoothing Pool |
| 🌐 **Community staking pool** | • Custom capacity & fee • Public Vault • No Vault token • Smoothing Pool |
| 🏢 **Node operator service** | • Custom capacity & fee • Private Vault per customer • No Vault token • Smoothing Pool (compliance dependent) |
| 💎 **Service with custom LST** | • Custom capacity & fee • Public Vault • Enable Vault token • Smoothing Pool (compliance dependent) |
| 🔒 **Service without LST** | • Custom capacity & fee • Public Vault • No Vault token • Disable osToken access |
