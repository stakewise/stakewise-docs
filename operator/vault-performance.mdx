# Vault Performance

## Overview

Vault performance represents the average performance of its validators. The scoring system derives a simple and effective formula for calculating Vault efficiency by evaluating the ratio of rewards to penalties, minimizing the influence of luck.

:::custom-info[Performance Components]
Vault efficiency consists of two main components:
- **🎯 Proposer Performance** (20% weight)
- **🗳️ Attester Performance** (80% weight)
:::

## 🎯 Proposer Performance

Block proposals depend on luck, but we penalize validators who miss MEV opportunities. Since MEV rewards can vary greatly between blocks, we focus only on the number of blocks processed and ignore reward sizes to avoid relying on chance.

### Calculation Method

We calculate the `proposal_score` by dividing the number of produced blocks by the total number of blocks. Validators are not negatively penalized for missed blocks; they get a score of 0 if they miss all their opportunities.

:::custom-notes[Formula: Proposer Score]
```
proposal_score = proposed_block_count / (proposed_block_count + missed_block_count)
```

**Where:**
- `proposed_block_count` – Number of successfully mined MEV blocks
- `missed_block_count` – Number of missed MEV blocks
:::

:::custom-warning[Fee Recipient Configuration]
A block is considered **missing** if the transaction fee or MEV is sent to the incorrect address, which negatively impacts the Vault performance score.

Verify that your validator clients are configured with the correct **fee recipient address**. You can locate this address (Block reward recipient) on the Vault page in the **Details** section.
:::

The proposer score is determined from statistics collected over the **past 7 days**.

## 🗳️ Attester Performance

### Attestation Rewards

85% of validator rewards come from attestations containing valuable information about consensus layer correctness and inclusion delay.

An attestation consists of three votes:
- **Head vote**
- **Source vote**
- **Target vote**

If a validator votes correctly on all three with optimal inclusion delay, they receive 100% of potential reward.

### Calculation Method

The beacon node API provides `idealReward` for an epoch representing maximum potential rewards based on optimal performance, allowing us to calculate attester efficiency:

:::custom-notes[Formula: Attester Score]
```
attester_score = total_rewards / ideal_rewards
```

**Where:**
- `total_rewards` – Sum of validators rewards fetched via beacon API
- `ideal_rewards` – Sum of ideal rewards fetched via beacon API
:::

The attester score is determined from statistics collected over the **past 7 days**.

### Sync Committee Exclusion

:::custom-info[Why Sync Committee is Ignored]
Sync committee rewards are excluded from calculations as they constitute only 3% of consensus layer rewards and depend entirely on luck.
:::

## 📊 Final Scoring Formula

The overall Vault performance combines both proposer and attester scores with weighted importance:

:::custom-notes[Formula: Overall Score]
```
score = (8/10 * attestations_score + 2/10 * proposal_score) * 100
```

This formula reflects that attestations are the primary source of validator rewards (80% weight), while block proposals provide additional value (20% weight).

## 🏆 Performance Grades

Vault grades are calculated based on the average performance over the last **7 days**:

<Tabs groupId="performance-grades">
  <TabItem value="excellent" label="🟢 Excellent" default>
    **99.6-100%**

    - No missed blocks or a very small percentage of them
    - Validators perform excellently in attestations
    - Less than 0.5% missed attestation rewards
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="good" label="🟡 Good">
    **99.2-99.6%**

    - No missed blocks or a very small percentage of them
    - Validators perform well in attestations
    - Less than 1% missed attestation rewards
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="moderate" label="🟠 Moderate">
    **97.1-99.2%**

    - The Vault has issues
    - Up to 3% missed attestations and/or blocks
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bad" label="🔴 Bad">
    **0-97.1%**

    - Validators are not performing correctly
    - Missing blocks or poorly handling attestations
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
